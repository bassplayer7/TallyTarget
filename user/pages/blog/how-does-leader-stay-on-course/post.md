I heard a story recently about the first manned flight to the moon. While we know the mission succeeded, do you know what percentage of the time the astronauts stayed on course?

The answer:  a resounding two percent!
 
The greatest minds in science were only able to stay on course two percent of the time. Still, the astronauts succeeded by using a series of course corrections when off the projected flight path.    

As a leader, do you find yourself frequently off course?  Do you even know if you are? And if so, how do you know what course corrections to make?    

Fortunately, God's Word provides us with the flight path we need to successfully navigate life.

Are you on course?
