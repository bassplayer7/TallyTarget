As the giant moves towards him, David runs quickly to meet him and then launches a stone from his sling. It flies through the air and lodges into Goliath's head, bringing him down. David then approaches Goliath, draws the giant's own sword and uses it to cut off the head of the fallen warrior. When David returns from the battlefield, he appears before King Saul, still holding Goliath's head (NIV, 1 Sam 17).

In this famous story, God uses a young man named David to lead Israel to victory over the Philistines.  What was the source of David's strength? Where did he find the courage to even face such a warrior? Can this story teach us how to defeat the enemies in our lives?

I think it can!

You see, man's greatest enemy is death itself. And just like David brought down Goliath, cut off his head and carried it to King Saul, Jesus, through his death and resurrection, cut off the head of death and presented it to the Heavenly King.  

Do you believe this?
